- get a string p to encrypt
- get a string k to use as key

- for each character in p:

    - if it is not a letter just print it and skip it
        - ask for next letter in p, do nothing to k
        
    - if it is a letter
        - find numeric value 0-25 - e.g. A or a = 0, Z or z = 25
        - look at first letter of k and convert to numeric value
        - use value of k to encrypt p to value e a la caesar
        - convert e to use same case as p and print it
        - ask for next character in p
        - ask for next character in k
            - if we just used the last character in k, circle back to first character in k
