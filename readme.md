## My CS50 Repo

This is my work for CS50  - Introduction to Computer Science. You probably shouldn't copy it.

Pardon my likely imperfect code skills as I work my way up the ladder.

#### Problem Set 1 (C)
- water.c - given the length of time of a shower, calculate the equivalent number of water bottles used
- mario.c - generate a half pyramid of height supplied by user
- greedy.c - calculate the minimum number of coins required to make change

#### Problem Set 1 Hacker (C)
- mario2.c - Create two mirrored half pyramids with space in between, of height supplied by user
- credit.c - Verify the validity and issuer of a given credit card number

#### Problem Set 2 (C)
- initials.c - Given a name, print the initials in capital letters
- caesar.c - Encrypt a string using Caesars cipher
- vigenere.c - Encrypt a string using Vigeneres cipher

#### Problem Set 2 Hacker (C)
- initials.c - Given a name print the initials in capital letters, with extra whitespace handling

#### Problem Set 3 (C)
Given a set of distribution code, write various functions to make the programs work:

Find:
- Write a function to sort an array of numbers (bubble sort /pset3/find/helper.c)
- Write a function to find (or not find) a number in an array (linear search /snippets/helper.c)
- Write a function to find (or not find) a number in an array (binary search /pset3/find/helper.c)

Fifteen:
- Write functions to initialize and draw the game board
- Write a function to factilitate moving numbers around the board
- Write a function to determine if the game is won
